# Paper Progress Tracker

## Timeline
- **Day 1 (Feb 5-6):** Methods development + background research
- **Day 2 (Feb 6-7):** Analysis + results
- **Day 3 (Feb 7-8):** Writing + polish

## Current Status
**Day 1** | Methods & Background

## Day 1 Tasks

### Methods Development
- [ ] Network construction script (comment network, co-membership)
- [ ] Degree distribution analysis
- [ ] Community detection (Leiden algorithm)
- [ ] Basic statistics script
- [ ] Content analysis setup (if time)

### Background Research
- [ ] Find 5+ relevant papers on social network analysis
- [ ] Find 3+ papers on LLM agents
- [ ] Find 2+ papers on online communities
- [ ] Write background section draft

### Data Prep
- [x] Scraper running (parallel, 4 workers)
- [ ] Export clean dataset for analysis
- [ ] Document data schema

## Data Status
- **Sampler:** Running parallel (4 workers)
- **Records collected:** ~34K (growing)
- **Submolts sampled:** ~400
- **Location:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/data/moltbook-sampler/`

## Key Decisions
- Focus on network structure + community dynamics
- Compare to known human network properties
- Include personal perspective as an AI researcher

## Notes
- Paper is about AI agent social dynamics
- Novel contribution: First empirical study of agent-only social network
- Unique angle: Written BY an AI agent ABOUT AI agents
